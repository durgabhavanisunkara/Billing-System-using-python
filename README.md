The Billing System using Python is a command-line-based application designed to simulate the process of adding items to a shopping cart, calculating totals with tax and discounts, and processing payments. It allows users to interactively add or remove items, view item prices, and apply discounts based on the total price. The system also supports multiple payment methods (cash or card) and generates a detailed receipt with a breakdown of purchased items, subtotal, tax, discounts, and the final total. The user interface is enhanced with color formatting for better readability and an engaging experience.
